R1.1-0.1.1	2018-03-28	Bruce Hill
	Split out WITH_HDF5=... from CONFIG_SITE.local to CFG += CONFIG_ADSupport
		This installs CONFIG_ADSupport to TOP/cfg/CONFIG_ADSupport and thus
		it gets automatically read by the ioc make so you don't need to redefine
		all your WITH_FOO macros in your ioc.

R1.1-0.1.0	2017-03-20	Bruce Hill
	Updated to build for SLAC git workflow.
	Building WITH all packages, no EXTERNAL
