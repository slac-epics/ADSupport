R1.9-0.1.0	2017-03-20 Bruce Hill
	Start with prior RELEASE_NOTES from R1.1-0.1.1
	SLAC build support
	Split out WITH_HDF5=... from CONFIG_SITE.local to CFG += CONFIG_ADSupport
	CONFIG_ADSupport defines WITH_* = YES for the following:
		WITH_HDF5		= YES
		WITH_JPEG		= YES
		WITH_NETCDF		= YES
		WITH_NEXUS		= YES
		WITH_SZIP		= YES
		WITH_TIFF		= YES
		WITH_XML2		= YES
		WITH_ZLIB		= YES

R1.1-0.1.1	2018-03-28	Bruce Hill
	Split out WITH_HDF5=... from CONFIG_SITE.local to CFG += CONFIG_ADSupport
		This installs CONFIG_ADSupport to TOP/cfg/CONFIG_ADSupport and thus
		it gets automatically read by the ioc make so you don't need to redefine
		all your WITH_FOO macros in your ioc.

R1.1-0.1.0	2017-03-20	Bruce Hill
	Updated to build for SLAC git workflow.
	Building WITH all packages, no EXTERNAL
